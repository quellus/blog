# Inspirations

I'm making a game with the working title, Cloudegde. I've had this game idea stuck in my head for a few years now. I saw this episode of Adventure Time. Finn is bored one day and he decides to go looking for an adventure. He goes out to the forest, starts looking around for anything out of place, pulls on random branches, and pokes random things until finally something opens up a secret dungeon entrance. He defeats a wacky dungeon boss, collects the loot and goes home to add the loot to the piles of treasure in their entry way. Ever since I saw that episode, I can't help but think that would be an amazing game loop. Go searchin an open world for hidden dungeons, defeat bosses, and decorate your home base with the loot you find.

This idea also scratches an itch I get whenever I play Minecraft. It's an incredible game with a beautiful procedurally generated overworld, and little reward for exploring it. To my knowledge, there is no way to progress through the game without spending hours swinging a pickaxe in a strip mine, and it's a shame. Every time I pick up Minecraft again, I find myself wishing for a wider variety of structures, dungeons, and better rewards for exploring the overworld. Some mods have tried to do this and a long time ago, I put some effort into trying to put together a mod pack, but to get something like this where I'm invisioning would require a mod that rewrites the core mechanics of the game.

The final main inspiration for this game is Skyrim. Skyrim rewards you for exploration in a way that I love. You can completely ignore all quests and just walk around until to find a dungeons to loot. The world is full of secrets to find and details you can only stumble upon by just walking around. The thing that's driving my inspiration the most right now, though, is Skyrim's alchemy system. I find it fasinating that in this medeival world riddled with war and dragons, where there's so many hostile enemies that want to kill you on site; stopping to pick flowers is an important mechanic to progress through the game. I love that in between fighting dragons and killing bandits, I'm encouraged to stop and pick snow berries on my travels, and I want to try to incorporate something like this into a game.

# Current state

If you didn't know, [Cloudedge is open source](https://github.com/quellus/Cloudedge). I'm also releasing [development builds on itch](https://quellus.itch.io/cloudedge) so I can get playtests early and often. My goal is to get a demo together. I'd like to create a town for the character to start in, a small story with a few simple quests, and a dungeon with a few enemies and a boss battle. I have some standin art for buildings and NPCs, some dialogues telling the player that there's something wrong with the forest, and a forest area with enemies and prototyped boss fight. Melee combat is working well, and while it needs a lot of tinkering and polish, I'm happy with the current state of it.

## Magic

My primary focus at this moment, though is magic. This is where I want to incorporate the flower picking idea. The magic system will run on consumables. Flowers you collect will be grinded into dust, and some of that dust will be consumed every time you cast a spell. I'd like to give the player tools to tinker with their spells as well. Different flower types will have different effects and yu can choose how much of each type gets consumed to change things like projectile speed, damage, and fire rate. I'm hoping this will make for a mechanic with tons of possibilities without being overwhelming and too complex.

## Story

So far for the story, the main character lived a pretty unremarkable life so far. They did some form of labor in their village and didn't really get involved in anything else. Then weird things started happening. Wildlife in the nearby forests suddenly became hostile, and occasionally they attack the village. Rumours started spreading that similar things are happening accross the kingdom. No one else in village is doing anything about it, so one day, your character decides to pick up a sword and see there's anything they can do.

This starts a snowball effect. People start hearing about how you helped your village and ask you for help with theirs. You continue going around helping more and more as word of your heroism spreads through thte realm and you slowly unlock clues about what's going on and how to solve the crisis once and for all.
