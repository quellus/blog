# Introduction

I've had this game idea stuck in my head. A few years ago, I saw this episode of Adventure Time. Finn is bored one day and he decides to go looking for an adventure. He goes out to the forest, starts looking around for anything out of place, pulls on random branches, and pokes random things until finally something opens up a secret dungeon entrance. He defeats a wacky dungeon boss, collects the loot and goes home to add the loot to the piles of treasure in their entry way. Ever since I saw that episode, I can't help but think that would be an amazing game loop. Go searchin an open world for hidden dungeons, defeat bosses, and decorate your home base with the loot you find.

This idea also scratches an itch I get whenever I play Minecraft. It's an incredible game with a beautiful procedurally generated overworld, and little reward for exploring it. To my knowledge, there is no way to progress through the game without spending hours swinging a pickaxe in a strip mine, and it's a shame. Every time I pick up Minecraft again, I find myself wishing for a wider variety of structures, dungeons, and better rewards for finding and defeating them. Some mods have tried to do this and I've put some effort into trying to put together a mod pack, but it would require making a mods that rewrites the core mechanics of the game.

So I'm working on that game. An open world ARPG that not only rewards you for going site seeing and strolling through the forest, it's how you progress through the game.

# Ambition

The over ambition started by planning on creating an incredibly deep procedural generation algorithm. This game would need an overworld as beautiful as Minecraft and really well designed dungeons. What if we didn't just generate dungeons, but we created a deep algorithm that makes every dungeon and every enemy feel unique. What if character has unique, generated dialogue. Before you fight each dungeon boss, you can listen to them explain the history of the dungeon, try to pursuade you to leave, or scare you with tales of their triumphs.

Then the scope started growing dramatically when I started thinking about open world RPGs. What better game to get overly ambitious inspiration from than Skyrim? A game with so many unique characters and dungeons where every character has something interesting to say. The quest I enjoyed the most wasn't even a quest at all. A drunk man in an inn whose wife went missing, and even though it doesn't get added to your quest book, you can get information about her by talking to other NPCs and follow clues until you find her. It was the most immersive experience I've had in Skyrim so far. Suddenly I wasn't doing a quest, I was a detective doing a favor for the man in the inn. So now the scope of this project has grown to adding diverse combat with a wide variety of weapons and magic. I want unique towns with tons of NPCs who have interesting things to say and tons and tons of quests to give. 

Oof what is our scope now? A deep procedurally generated dungeon system, a beautiful procedurally generated overworld, towns with tons of NPCs, complex dialog trees for every NPC, and hundreds of quests. As a solo developer, I think a good delivery estimate for this game would about...20 years. We got this.

# Breaking it down and making a prototype

It's really hard to tell with any amount of certainty whether a game idea is even worth investing any time into. You never really know if you're on the right track until you make a prototype and get it in other people's hands. I needs to be break this idea down to its core mechanics. Prioritize only things that are important so I can create something playable and get feedback.

The state of development right now, is that I'm prioritizing making a combat system that's fun. It's the core of this game, if the combat isn't fun, conquering dungeons won't be fun. I've also put together some programmer art for a town and started developing the dialog system. The NPCs tell you that there's something wrong with the creatures in the forest. When you leave the town, you meet the first enemy of the game, giant red mushrooms. My priority now is prototyping a boss battle and continuing to develop the behavior trees and combat until it's fun.

Once that's done, I can move to the next priority. Adding variety to combat, developing the world, or adding a variety of enemies.

This project is open source, you can follow the progress on my GitHub, and I live stream the majority of my development on YouTube on Twitch
