title: "What I learned upgrading my Homelab servers to HTTPS"

# Introduction

I have quite a few home servers. For the most part, they can only be accessed from within my home network. As far as security goes, the only thing I'm certain of is that the servers I have are not security enough to safely open them to the outside world. So I thought I could solve two problems at once. By analyzing my home servers and solving their security flaws, I can generally improve the security of my network, and also expand my knowledge of cyber security concepts.

For the first part of this process, I started upgrading all the HTTP servers I have to HTTPS. Here's a knowledge dump of everything I learned throughout that process. The solutions I found to problems I came across and the answers I found to questions I had a long the way.

# Why am I learning HTTPS?

A security flaw that has been glaringly obvious to me is most of my servers communicate via unencrypted HTTP. Some of them are password protected, some of them aren't. The password protections seem pretty pointless when every time I log in, those credentials are sent in plaintext out in the open. So an obvious first step is to implement HTTPS encryption.

# HTTPS is weird on an intranet

Something that became obvious pretty quickly is that HTTPS is a little bit weird when communication is limited to a small network. The more I'm digging into this, the more I am finding limitations in doing so. Most things are designed not to accept certificates that cannot be verified by a trusted Certificate Authority.

# How HTTPS works

 * How public and private key communication works.
 * Only encrypted one way?
    * Symmetric key exchange
 * TLS handshake cashing
    * Is a new symmetric key exchanged every time a request is made
 * Certificate validation via a certificate authority

# TLS vs SSL, what's the difference and which is still used today?
