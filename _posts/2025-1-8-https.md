# Introduction

I use my home network as a playground for learning new technologies and finding unique solutions to minor inconveniences in my life. For example, I couldn't find a thermostat on the market that can control both an evaporative cooler and furnace. I was frustrated that each needed its own thermostat, so I designed and built a thermostat myself that could do both. This thermostat is a Raspberry Pi computer that hosts an SSH server, webserver, and Python Fast API in order to work properly. Currently, it's incredibly insecure.

As it stands right now, I can only check on my thermostat and control it when I am physically in my house. I would love to the idea to open it to the outside world so I can access it from anywhere, but if I can access it from anywhere, so can all the hackers of the world. If I did that, I would need to spend a lot of time making sure this server is secure and I would need to learn a lot more about cyber security to be confident I did so effectively.

So in this adventure, I had two goals...well technically 3 if you include this blog post:
1. Learn about HTTPS
2. Implement HTTPS on all my self-hosted servers that are currently using HTTP
3. Document my learning and findings in this blog post

# How HTTPS works

HTTPS aims to do two things. The one I'm most interested in on this adventure is it encrypts the communication between the client and server. The other is it ensures the server is who it says it is via a certificate authority.

## Message flow

I love message flows. I find it to be pretty helpful way to understand how things communicate. This diagram is a little simplified, but it highlights the important communication between client and server when establishing a connection.

1. The first thing that happens is the client says hello to the server to let the server know the client exists and wants to establish a connection.
2. I included the server hello because it showed up in most of the resources I found, but I didn't dig deep enough to figure out what the contents of the message actually are. 
3. The server sents its certificate. This certificate has 3 functions.
   1. The client can use the certificate to verify the identity of the server via a trusted Certificate Authority.
   2. The client can use the certificate to encrypt its messages so only the server can decrypt them.
   3. The server can use its private key to encrypt its messages so that anyone with the certificate can decrypt it. Since only the server should have the private key, this allows the client to verify the messages came from the server and no one else.
3. The client uses the ability to send messages only the server can decrypt to send the server a symmetric cypher key. This allows the server to send messages only the client can decrypt.
4. Now the client can make its requests normally and the server will respond. Everything is well encrypted and secret.

# What is SSL and TLS? Are they different?

Throughout this adventure I kept coming across the acronyms SSL and TLS. Sometimes I would find tutorials that refer to HTTPS as SSL, but I would also find tutorials that refer to the protocol as TLS. The library used to generate keys and certificates is called `openssl`, but when I was researching information about the message flows between client and server, everything referred to TLS. So I kept asking what the heck SSL and TLS are, whether they are completely different things, or just different parts of the same tech stack. So here's my current understanding.

Most of what I learned is outlined in this [Cloudflare article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/). It turns out, SSL and TLS kind of are the same thing and different things at the same time. SSL is the name of protocol for encrypting HTTPS messages. It was the original name given to it by the creators. I'm not sure if Netscape created it or acquired it. Eiether way it was called SSL when it was under Netscape's ownership. In 1999, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) took ownership of the protocol and changed the name to TLS when they released an update. Technically, everything about the protocol today is TLS, we just use TLS and SSL interchangeably.

# HTTPS is weird on an intranet

Okay I feel the need the need to put on my foil hat a little bit to introduce this section. I know it's a little weird that I'm going through so much effort to encrypt traffic that never leaves my home network. I am doing most of this for learning, but I also have a significant distrust for all things when it comes to cyber security. Well known and trustworthy companies release products with zero-day vulnerabilities all the time. I don't trust that my router isn't going to allow a bad actor into my network if they ask nicely enough. Also, if I do open up a server to the outside world it's not impossible for someone to use that server to find a way in and start poking around my network.

So remember that message flow diagram a few sections ago? Remember how the client verifies the certificate with a certificate authority? Well, that's a problem on a local network. A certificate authority isn't going to verify a server that isn't accessible to the world so we just don't have a certificate authority in this scenario. Instead, the server acts as its own authority. This is called a "self signed" certificate. When the server delivers the certificate, it just says "trust me bro, I'm trustworthy...I swear". Honestly, that's fine for my use case. It's my server. I know it's trustworthy.

Unfortunately, a lot of browsers and apps don't like this. Most browsers will require the user to click through a ton of warnings before allowing communication with the unverified server to continue, some apps will outright refuse to establish the connection. It's a good thing these protections exist. In every situation except my exact use case, connecting to an unverifiable server would be a real security risk. At the time of writing this post, I haven't found a solid solution yet. I know that most devices have a way to add trusted certificates, but manually adding the certificates of each server on my network to every device that wants to connect is a lot of work. I hope I can share a good solution to this problem in my next post.
