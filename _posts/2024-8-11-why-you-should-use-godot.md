# Introduction

Choosing a game engine is one of the most stressful parts when deciding to get into game dev. It shouldn't be such a huge decision. In the end it doesn't matter all that much. There's a ridiculous amount of options and a new game engine gets created seemingly every day. I'm going to be comparing the big 3 game engines: Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot, specifically, whether or not Godot is right for you compared to the others. I don't have much knowledge about Unreal, mainly I will be comparing Godot and Unity.

I can't tell you with certainty which game engine is best for *you* because I don't know who you are, but I have a lot of opinions that might help you decide. For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to simplify game devs to two sides of a spectrum. On one extreme, your motivations for getting into game dev might purely be about learning. You want to learn about programming, shaders, or 3D modelling, and you want to do it all yourself for maximum learning. Maybe you'll build something cool along the way. On the other extreme, you don't care about the development part. You have a game idea you're really excited about and you want to utilize the tools available as much as you can just to make the game exist.

# The Good of Godot (Goodot)

Godot is an amazing engine. Making things in Godot is the majority of the content YouTube and Twitch channels.

Its user interface is friendly. The node system feels very simple to use. The documentation, while imperfect is really useful.

Godot is free forever


# The Bad of Godot

Godot doesn't have much of an asset store. This can be a huge downside if you're not interested in learning and doing things yourself. With the other options, the asset stores are so fast, you could theoretically make an entire game without having to code or 3D model anything yourself.

Godot is a young engine. It's buggy and things are changing quickly. In our PNGTuber program, we're dealing with a bug that creates horrible latency after about 30 minutes. This bug is documented and there's nothing we can do other than find a workaround and wait for them to fix it in a future update.

Sometimes this is great. We're helping find bugs and improve the engine, things are constantly being updated and fixed, but this also means sometimes that things are just broken or features are just missing, and there isn't much we can do about it.

Godot is inneficient for 3D

# Conclusion

Every engine has pros and cons. It doesn't have to be a giant decision and really the best way to figure it out is to make something simple in each one and choose the one you enjoyed the most.
