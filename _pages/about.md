I'm Quellus. In May 2024 I left my job as a Software Engineer to pursue indie game development. I aim to learn as much as I can about Godot and teach as much of what I learn as possible.

I stream almost all of my development to [Twitch](twitch.tv/quellusdev) and make [YouTube](youtube.com/@quellusdev) videos about what I learn.

I hope this blog helps you.

Let's learn Godot together!
